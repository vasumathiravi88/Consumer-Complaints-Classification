# Consumer_Complaint Classification
Consumer complaint categorization relies on Natural Language Processing and Multiclass Classification. To address this, we required a dataset comprising consumer-reported complaints. I identified a suitable dataset containing:  Complaint nature, Consumer-mentioned issue, Detailed complaint description

- **Problem**: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regularly forwards numerous consumer complaints regarding financial products and services to companies for responses. The task involves categorizing these complaints into their respective product categories based on the complaint descriptions.

- **Solution**: This project's objective is to precisely classify complaints into specific product categories, making it a multiclass classification problem suitable for various machine learning algorithms. With a functioning algorithm in place, newly submitted complaints can be promptly categorized and routed to the appropriate individuals. This streamlined process minimizes the need for human intervention in determining the appropriate recipient, resulting in significant time savings.
